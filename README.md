# REAL TIME HAND GESTURE DETECTOR

In this project I tried to make a real time Hand Gesture Detector using Python, OpenCV, Tensorflow, Mediapipe.

PREREQUISITES :

1. Python(ver 3.9.0) 
2. OpenCV(ver 4.5.4.60) 
3. Mediapipe(ver 0.8.9)
4. Numpy(ver 1.20.2) 
5. Tensorflow(ver 2.7.0)

The Hand Gesture dataset used here does not belong to me. I downloaded the dataset from the below link.

Currently, working on improvement of the accuracy of the pre-trained model.
